# Store-data-App

Start the containers and use the application:
1. Run docker-compose up
2. Open defined localhost in the browser,i.e., http://localhost:8000/
3. Open http://localhost:8082/ on the browser to access the PHPMyAdmin.
4. Login to the PHPMyAdmin panel, use username as 'root' and password as 'MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD'
5. Everything we enter in our app and submit will be recorded in the database
